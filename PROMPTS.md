1. Project Setup & Skeleton
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are a senior Node.js/TypeScript backend engineer specializing in building modular monolithic architectures with event-driven capabilities.

User Prompt:

Please review the following system requirements for a Digital Queue Management System:
We need a “modular monolith” in Node.js (Express + TypeScript).
Main components: Customer Portal API, Queue Management API, Admin Panel API, Notification System, WebSocket Real-Time Updates, and an internal event bus.
We will eventually deploy to AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions using a Makefile-based CI/CD.
Generate a project scaffolding that includes:
A root package.json with necessary dependencies (express, ws, typescript, etc.).
A src folder with subfolders for customer-portal, queue-management, admin-panel, notification-system, websocket, and event-bus.
A basic TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json).
A simple server.ts or index.ts that bootstraps the modular monolith structure.
A placeholder for tests and a sample Makefile with tasks for build, test, and deploy.
Show me the initial file structure and minimal placeholder code for each file.
Instructions:

Don’t implement actual business logic yet; just show the foundational skeleton.
Provide short explanations about each folder and file in code comments.



Techniques Used & Explanation

Role Prompting: “You are a senior Node.js/TypeScript backend engineer...” sets the context and expertise level.
Instruction-based Prompting: We explicitly list the tasks (create scaffolding, show placeholders).
Step-by-Step/Incremental Approach: We only want the skeleton now, no business logic.
Output Constraint: We ask for minimal code placeholders with an explanation of each.




2. Domain & Queue Management Layer
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are a Node.js domain-driven design expert, focusing on how to separate business logic from controllers and data access.

User Prompt:

Based on our skeleton, create a Domain Layer for the queue management, under src/queue-management/domain.
Define domain models and interfaces (e.g., QueueEntry, Table, WaitTimeCalculator).
Implement minimal business logic methods (e.g., joinQueue, assignTable, calculateWaitTime) with placeholder logic for now.
Demonstrate how you’d use custom error classes for business errors (e.g., QueueFullError).
Techniques Used & Explanation

Domain-Specific Prompting: We specify “create a domain layer with business logic.”
Few-Shot or Example-driven: By giving example methods (joinQueue, assignTable), we guide the LLM to produce code aligned with our specs.
Structured Request: “1. Create folder… 2. Define domain models… 3. Implement minimal logic… 4. Show custom errors.”
3. Internal Event Bus & Decoupling
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are an expert in event-driven Node.js systems, adept at using an internal, in-memory event bus and future-proofing for external solutions like Kafka or SQS.

User Prompt:

We want to implement an in-memory event bus in src/event-bus/index.ts.
Show how each module (Queue Management, Notification System, etc.) can publish/subscribe to events (EVENT_QUEUE_UPDATED, EVENT_TABLE_ASSIGNED, etc.).
Use Node’s EventEmitter (or a similar pattern) as a placeholder and illustrate how we could later swap it out for Kafka or SQS.
Provide example usage in the queue management layer (e.g., when a new table is assigned, emit an event).
Techniques Used & Explanation

Role + Context: We specifically mention “in-memory event bus” with a path to future solutions.
Instruction-based: We enumerate exactly what we want (publish/subscribe pattern, placeholders, usage example).
Implementation Focus: We direct the LLM to show code that demonstrates how modules communicate events.
4. REST & GraphQL APIs for Queue Management
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are a REST and GraphQL API specialist, familiar with TypeScript and Express.

User Prompt:

In the queue-management module, create both a REST API controller and a GraphQL resolver with feature parity:
Endpoints/resolvers for joinQueue, getQueueStatus, assignTable.
Show minimal Express routes (POST /v1/queue/join, GET /v1/queue/status) and GraphQL schema/resolver definitions.
Integrate domain layer methods from the previous step.
Demonstrate error handling and standard responses (e.g., how you return QueueFullError to the client).
Techniques Used & Explanation

Parallel Implementation: We ask for both REST and GraphQL solutions.
Schema-driven Prompt: We specify route names and GraphQL resolvers explicitly.
Error Handling: We remind the LLM to demonstrate how to return standardized error objects.
5. Notification System
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are a backend developer with expertise in Twilio, Firebase Push Notifications, and event-driven design for notifications.

User Prompt:

Implement a Notification System in src/notification-system.
Listen to events from the Event Bus (EVENT_TABLE_ASSIGNED).
Integrate Twilio for SMS and Firebase for Push notifications.
Use environment variables (TWILIO_API_KEY, FIREBASE_CONFIG) for config.
Show a code snippet handling the scenario: “Send an SMS when a table is assigned.”
Techniques Used & Explanation

Contextual Prompting: We reference the event bus from the previous step.
Realistic Implementation: We specify environment variables and usage patterns.
Event-Driven Instruction: We highlight which event triggers the notification code.
6. Real-Time WebSocket Updates
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are a real-time communication specialist, proficient in WebSocket architecture for Node.js.

User Prompt:

Implement WebSocket support in the src/websocket module.
Use ws or Socket.IO (whichever is simpler for demonstration).
Broadcast queue status changes to customers via WebSocket events (e.g., QUEUE_UPDATED).
Show code that ties the event bus events (EVENT_QUEUE_UPDATED) to WebSocket broadcasts.
Provide a basic front-end snippet (pseudo-code) to demonstrate how the client would subscribe to updates.
Techniques Used & Explanation

Role & Context: We specify “real-time communication specialist.”
Example-driven: The LLM is asked to show an example client snippet for clarity.
Integration with Event Bus: We maintain a consistent architecture by hooking into the same events.
7. Local Dockerized Infrastructure & Makefile
Prompt:

System/Role Prompt:
You are an expert in Docker, Docker Compose, and Makefile-based automation.

User Prompt:

Provide a Docker Compose file that runs:
Node.js API (the monolith).
DynamoDB Local (or Firestore Emulator).
A mock notification service (to simulate Twilio).
Update the Makefile:
make build → builds Docker images.
make start → spins up Docker Compose.
make test → runs tests inside containers.
make deploy → placeholder for AWS/GCP deploy steps.
Ensure environment variables are set via .env or Docker Compose overrides.
Techniques Used & Explanation

Instruction-based: We specify each service in Docker Compose.

How These Prompts Use Excellent Prompt Engineering
Role Prompting: Each prompt sets a specific “role” or “expert persona” for the LLM, ensuring the responses are tuned to that specialty.
Incremental / Step-by-Step Approach: We don’t ask the LLM to build the entire system at once. Instead, we break down tasks into smaller steps, reducing complexity and confusion.
Instruction-based Prompting: We clearly enumerate each step (“1. Do this… 2. Do that…”) so the LLM can systematically address every requirement.
Context Preservation: We remind the LLM of relevant details (e.g., previously created domain methods, environment variables) so it can build upon prior steps.
Output Constraints & Format: We specify the desired output style—like folder structures, code placeholders, or minimal code snippets—to keep the responses concise.
Error Handling & Explanation: We ask the LLM to show how to handle errors or logs, demonstrating real-world best practices.
Few-Shot / Example-driven: By giving examples (like specific event names, route paths, or error objects), we guide the LLM to produce code aligned with our domain and consistent naming.
Using this series of carefully crafted prompts will help you incrementally build each part of your Digital Queue Management System while leveraging best practices in prompt engineering—ensuring clarity, focus, and alignment with your project’s requirements.
