### üõ†Ô∏è Key System Features  
- **Customer Portal** ‚Üí Customers can join queues, check status, and receive notifications.  
- **Admin Panel** ‚Üí Staff can register tables, manage queues, and adjust availability.  
- **Real-Time Updates** ‚Üí Customers and admins receive live status changes.  
- **Notification System** ‚Üí Customers get notified via SMS/Push when their table is ready.  
- **GraphQL Support** ‚Üí Both REST and GraphQL APIs work in parallel, ensuring compatibility.

|----------------------|----------------|-------------|  
| Queue Management    | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |  
| Notifications       | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |  
| Admin Panel        | ‚úÖ Fully Supported | ‚úÖ Fully Supported |  
| Versioning        | ‚úÖ Path-based (/v1) | ‚úÖ Schema-based |  

## üèóÔ∏è Automation and CI/CD (Makefile)  
A Makefile is provided to handle essential automation tasks:  
- **Build:** Compiles TypeScript and bundles dependencies.  
- **Test:** Runs unit and integration tests.  
- **Deploy:** Pushes the service to AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.  
- **Execute Use Cases:** Runs business use cases one by one.  
- **Linting:** Ensures code consistency with ESLint and Prettier.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Dockerized Infrastructure  
- Local development runs on Docker Compose.  
- Services include a Node.js API, DynamoDB Local, Redis (for WebSockets), and a mock notification service.  
- Ensures parity with staging and production environments.  

## üîÄ Environment Parity: Local ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production  
- The same **Dockerized stack** runs across all environments.  
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is implemented using **Terraform or AWS CDK**.  
- Staging mirrors production settings but with **sandboxed test data**.  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Elegant Exception Handling  

### Business and System Error Handling  
- **Business Layer:** Uses custom error classes to standardize domain-related failures.  
- **Presentation Layer:** Ensures consistent, normalized error responses across APIs.  
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Structured logs for post-processing and analytics.  

### Example Error Categories  
- **Business Errors:** "Queue Full", "Invalid Table Size".  
- **System Errors:** "Database Unavailable", "Third-Party API Failure".  
- **Security Errors:** Unauthorized API calls or access violations.  

Structured logs ensure that errors are indexed and processed efficiently.
